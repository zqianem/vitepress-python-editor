# VitePress Python Editor

An `Editor` Vue component (CodeMirror + Pyodide) intended for inline use in a VitePress docs site.

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

## TODO

- [ ] use `<dialog>` instead of `prompt()` for `input()`
- [ ] terminate and restart worker if interrupts don't stop in time
- [ ] publish this as a package and document usage
